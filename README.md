### This tool enable a mobilizon user to post in their account. 

Read [here for usage tips and documentation](https://quickened.interoperability.tracking.exposed/mobilizon-poster).

We should separate the tool from the groups managed by individual, if you want to keep a small list:

- https://mobilize.berlin/@radarsquatnet\_repost
- https://mobilize.berlin/@facebook\_repost
- [add yours via PR]

This is a work in progress, in April-May 2021, _reach out for discussion in mobilizon discord server_.
