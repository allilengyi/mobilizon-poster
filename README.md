# mobilizon-poster

A simple nodejs script(s) to interact with mobilizon via command line.

It grows _organically_ it means it might not follow a precise and robust development pattern. You should consider this is an alpha stage working prototype.

## This tool enable a mobilizon user to post in their account. 

Read [here for usage tips and documentation](https://quickened.interoperability.tracking.exposed/mobilizon-poster).

We should separate the tool from the groups managed by individual, if you want to keep a small list:
