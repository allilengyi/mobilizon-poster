This folder contains scripts for specific domains, they all share one common goal:

# THESE SCRIPTS PRODUCE A LIST OF URL THAT POINT TO .ICS FILES

Apologies for the extreme words ahead, but protocols are strict:

* the output MUST start with \/http.\*\/
* the URL MUST point, even after some redirect, to an `.ics` file
* a script might generate as many URL as necessay
